This is a little pet project where I explore the creation of a game engine pretty much from the ground up.

PyGame has been used to provide easy OpenGL access and basic window creation as well as timing control.

Ye who enter here expect to find mistakes and debatable decisions. Also anything can change at any moment, as this is pretty much endless experimentation and exploration.
